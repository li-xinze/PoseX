\begin{tablenotes}
\item[1] The first conformation was chosen when multiple conformations were available in the PDB entry.
\item[2] Clustering with MMseqs2 is done with an sequence identity threshold of 90\% and a minimum coverage of 80\%.
\item[3] Each candidate protein is structurally aligned to the reference protein via superposition of $C_{\alpha}$ atom of amino acid residues using PyMOL. A candidate PDB entry is removed if the RMSD of the protein alignment is greater than 2.0 \angstrom~and a candidate ligand is removed if it is  4.0 \angstrom~away from the reference ligand.
